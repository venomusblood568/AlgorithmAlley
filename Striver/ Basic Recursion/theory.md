 **Basic Recursion<br>**
1 ) RECURSION = Recursion in DSA is a technique where a function solves a problem by calling itself with smaller instances of the same problem until a base case is reached.

2) STACK OVERFLOW = Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer website where programmers can seek solutions and share knowledge.

3) BASE CONDITION = The base condition in DSA is the termination criterion that stops recursive algorithms.

4) RECURSION TREE = The recursion tree in DSA represents the hierarchical structure of recursive function calls and their respective subproblems.

5) BASE CASE = The base case in DSA is the condition that halts the recursion and provides a non-recursive solution or termination point.
